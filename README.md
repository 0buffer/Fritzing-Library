AdaFruit Fritzting Library
==========================

A library of parts for [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/)

If you would like to use the entire library, then download AdaFruit.fzbz and
open it in Fritzing (File | Open... )

If you wish to make it a permanent resident of your Fritzing parts pallete, use
the drop-down menu in the pallette window and choose "Save Bin".

Individual parts files are located in the "parts" folder. Each of these is in 
the form of an .FZPZ file, which is a standard .ZIP file generated by Fritzing.
They contain all the SVG image and the FPZ part file, and can be opened with a 
standard archive utility like 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/)
