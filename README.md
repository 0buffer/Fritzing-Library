AdaFruit Fritzting Library
==========================

A library of parts for [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/)

If you would like to just use the parts then just download AdaFruit.fzbz and
open it in Fritzing (File | Open... )

If you wish to make it a permanent resident of your Fritzing parts pallete, use
the drop-down menu in the pallette window and choose "Save Bin".
