AdaFruit Fritzing Library
==========================

A library of parts for [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/)

If you would like to use the entire library, then download AdaFruit.fzbz and
open it in Fritzing (File | Open... )

If you wish to make it a permanent resident of your Fritzing parts pallete, use
the drop-down menu in the pallette window and choose "Save Bin".

Individual parts files are located in the "parts" folder. Each of these is in 
the form of an .FZPZ file, which is a standard .ZIP file generated by Fritzing.
They contain all the SVG images and the FPZ part file, and can be opened with a 
standard archive utility like 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/)

Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers, artists, 
researchers and hobbyists to work creatively with interactive electronics. 
We are creating a software and website in the spirit of Processing and 
Arduino, developing a tool that allows users to document their prototypes, 
share them with others, teach electronics in a classroom, and to create a 
pcb layout for professional manufacturing.
